# BNB Chain - Web3 Security Framework

### Crypto Wallet Security Checklist

Classification: **Restricted**

**Stage: Enquiry stage (40)**

**Introduction**:

The Web3 Security Framework Initiative is a collaborative effort to promote the adoption of best practices in web3 security. The initiative aims to minimize the risks associated with security vulnerabilities and hacks, which have become increasingly prevalent in the web3 space. Moreover, projects that demonstrate full compliance with our rigorous guidelines will earn an on-chain certificate recognized by all the AvengerDAO members on the BNB Chain ecosystem.

This document serves as a comprehensive checklist of the critical elements surrounding the secure management of crypto wallets.
